1. When adding a new component, like sample apps: servicesApp, customerApp, remember to add an entry in priority.yaml file, like:
  -
    priority: 99
    name: services
    custom: yes
  -
    priority: 100
    name: customer
    custom: yes
  - 
    priority: 101
    name: opsviz
    custom: yes
2. When it pops error: "uncaught exception: Ext.Loader is not enabled,
 so dependencies cannot be resolved dynamically".

Check the table:resource_bundle to make sure column scripts has correctly spelled path/file name to the js file.
